# cpt202-a19-reservation

#### Description
Currently, in XJTLU campus, we have noticed that only the seminar rooms in library of CB and IBSS have online reservation apps, while the classrooms in other buildings have no such kind of apps to reserve spare classrooms, which means that it is extremely inconvenient for students to find a place for self-study in the campus, and there are often conflicts and chaos of the right to use each spare classroom. Therefore, our group is going to develop a web app to solve this issue.
